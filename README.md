# About
This is the Open source repository for our Group promotion system.
It allows you to promote users to various ranks based o their rank in 'sub groups', for example departments.
Examples are included in the examples directory.

# How to use
You will need to run the server on a VPS or something like Glitch. Then you can either take the code from the `source` directory, or alternatively make use of an example game from the `examples` folder.

You can check out the Module under the `source` directory. 
## How did you export a Roblox model?
I used the tiny module [rbx-export](https://github.com/Neztore/rbx-export), created by yours truly, which is available on NPM.
